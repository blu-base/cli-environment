" Sort motion - sort based on motion or text object

Plug 'christoomey/vim-sort-motion'


" Usage:
" 
" Linewise:
" 
" The primary interface to this plugin is via the gs mapping, for sorting based on a text object or motion. To use the mapping, type gs followed by a motion, ie 2j to sort down two lines.
" 
" Examples:
" 
"     gs2j => Sort down two lines (current + 2 below)
"     gsip => Sort the current paragraph
"     gsii => Sort the current indentation level (requires text-obj-indent plugin)
" 
" Character
" 
" In addition, if the text object is within a line then sort-motion will attempt to sort the text as a comma separated list.
" 
" Examples:
" 
" gsi( => Sort within parenthesis. (b, c, a) would become (a, b, c)
